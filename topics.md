these are usually a long list of things people in the lab need access to: servers, software packages, commonly used web tools, shared credentials, room keys and other physical resources, etc

# EXTERNAL RESOURCES
how to get a library card; which building has the best photocopier; useful websites and tutorials, etc

# ONBOARDING
master list of everything that new lab members need to deal with when starting out, including credentials, software, hardware, keys, university ID, etc

# DAY-TO-DAY

# ETHICS AND SAFETY
irb procedures; safety procedures; what to do when something goes wrong; what to do/who to call in an emergency

# ENGAGEMENT
how lab website and social media work; expectations surrounding public outreach, including from official lab accounts; social media policy for personal accounts; protocol for recruiting participants in the community; being a good departmental citizen

# HOW TO RUN EXPERIMENTS
detailed instructions for doing research; some labs do this for all experiments separately while others have a general set of instructions like "how you should interact with participants"; how to compensate participants

# DATA ANALYSIS
how the lab does analyses; expectations concerning how code is written, version controlled, and archived; how to handle data protection and security. this one overlaps with OPEN SCIENCE quite a bit

# PUBLICATIONS
how the lab deals with authorship, including the differences between listing in acknowledgments & co-authors; checklist of everything to do before a paper is published; policies on preprints, postprints, and open access; preferences about journals

# CONFERENCES
how to give a talk; which conferences do lab members usually attend and why; technology considerations surrounding visualizations; data considerations for work-in-progress; discussion of #betterposter or #worseposter, etc

how to get support from inside or outside the lab; schedule of routine training for new members; things that bear repeating like "always ask questions!"; how to make mistakes productively

# READING LIST
a list of papers, blog posts, and news articles that all students and lab members should read

# platforms
I saw handbooks hosted in standalone files (word, pdf, rmd), gdocs, text on github, OSF wikis, gitbooks, and more. (we're using gitbook for now!)
